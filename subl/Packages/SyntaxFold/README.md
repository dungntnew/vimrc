#SyntaxFold - Sublime Text Plugin

A plugin for [Sublime Text][st] 3 that folds code blocks based on syntax rather than indent.  

##Background
This plugin was created for a language that uses named regions similar to languages like VB, C++ and C# (see [here][vs]). Where possible use a plugin created specifically for your syntax.

##Installation
* Use [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control "Sublime Package Control")
* `ctrl+shift+p` then select `Package Control: Install Package`
* Install SyntaxFold

Alternatively Clone this repository to your Sublime Text packages directory


###Setup
* On first use open the quick panel <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> 

![][add-another]
* select add another to set any custom fold markers

![][custom-fold]
* open the quick panel <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd> again to set your default marker


* You can specify start and end markers, or if you just specify the start marker then it will fold up to the next start marker.
